# agario_a-life
An Agario-esque artificial life simulation.

This artificial life simulation mimics the simple game mechanics of the popular browser game, Agario (http://www.agar.io). A 2-dimensional world is populated with intelligent blobs and food. Eating food increases the mass--and thus the size--of a blob. Blobs may eat other blobs that they are substantially larger than, which also contributes positively to their mass.

This simulation controls blobs via an artificial life system. These blobs gradually evolve, as more fit blobs are more likely to contribute to subsequent populations. Slight mutations are also applied randomly to new populations.
